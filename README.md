# Data Analysis on emails dataset

## It will cover the following sections:

### Data Preparation and Training:
  In this notebook :
  1. We are using the emails.csv dataset which gives the description about the mails and the frequency of the words used in each mail.
  2. Importing the essential libraries sich as numpy, pandas, sklearn etc. 
  3. Converting dataset into dataframes.
  4. Preparing the data by finding the correlation, description, etc.
  5. Training the data on different models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine.
       #### Naive Bayes Model:
       It works on the every individual word in the test data to make predictions.
       #### Support Vector Machine:
       It works on the finding the maximal margin between the support vectors.
       
### Data Testing:
  In this notebook:
  1. We are testing the data using the mentioned models.
  2. We are finding the accuracy of the models.

### To run the code:
  1. Clone the repository of Github on our device.
  2. Run the data training and data testing files.
  3. That's completed.
